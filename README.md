# sardegna-scala
A repository of Scala programs that I have developed to hone my skills in functional programming. Three primary goals of this endeavor are: to develop (quasi-) automated techniques for compiler/parser development; to develop an automated framework for data analytics; and to develop faster prototypes for design automation.
